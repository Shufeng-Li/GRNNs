Description: This General Regression Neural Networks Package uses various distance functions.
     It was motivated by Specht (1991, ISBN:1045-9227), and updated from previous published paper 
     Li et al. (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.11.005>. This package includes various functions, 
     although "euclidean" distance is used traditionally.
